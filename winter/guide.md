**What? Where? When?**  
Tomorrowland Winter will be held in ***Alpe d'Huez, Southern France 14 - 22 March 2020.*** It's a special Winter edition of Tomorrowland and this is the 2nd edition. The whole village of Alpe d'Huez will be rented *exclusively* for Tomorrowland visitors.  

**How to get tickets and how much do they cost?**  
There will be 30 000 tickets sold in total. Prices can already be found at the [Simulator](https://simulator.winterpackages.tomorrowland.com/en). All packages are either 7 or 4 days and include a Full madness-festival pass, Ski Pass and lodging. You can choose a flight package, a bus package or getting there on your own.

In addition to the packages, it will be possible to upgrade to comfort, buy lessons and ski rentals, transport to the Alpe d'Huez, book restaurants, etc.   

**How is payment done?**  
[Here is a link explaining payment](https://www.tomorrowland.com/en/winter/packages/payment-methods-and-conditions). Basically you pay a part immediately at purchase and the rest during 10 days.  

**Getting to Alpe D'huez**  
If you are travelling from outside of France, then flying into Grenoble, Lyon or Geneva is likely to be the quickest way to get to Alpe d'Huez. Alpe d'Huez is then a bus ride or private transfer (taxi or minibus) from these main hubs, unless you’re driving yourself.  

Grenoble is the closest airport (1.5 hours) but flight options are limited and can be more expensive, whereas Geneva has a greater choice of airlines offering better value flights but is a longer commute to resort (3 hours).

Pay attention to where your accommodation is located. Some are 30km away from the festival area and even though there is a free bus, we recommend to take anything closer to the festival.

**What will the weather be like?**  
In 2019 the weather went from warm, perfect skiing days to zero vision snowstorms and everything in-between. Prepare to get wet, for wind, for snow and all kinds!  

**What about the stages, how are they set up?**  
There are all kinds of stages on the slopes, at the festival site, on top of mountains! It's a very unique experience.

**Lineup & Schedule**
