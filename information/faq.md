# General FAQ 

Common questions and answers:

## I am not going anymore can I resell my ticket?

After ticket sales the exchange desk will open which will allow you to refund some or all of your tickets minus fees. This is the only official way to refund tickets.

## Can I use Card X? or card Y in the sales?

Most debit and credit cards should work (visa, mastercards, ect) just make sure there is enough on the card and your bank doesn't block the transaction. Tomorrowland keep an up to date list of accepted cards on their website.

## How many people can I buy tickets for?

You can purchase up to four passes for tomorrowland. So for example you could purchase one two person easy tent and two MG passes bringing your total passes for tomorrowland up to four. The only exception to this is the larger purchases like friendship garden where you can purchase ten passes at once.

## My friend has dropped out but another is taking his place, can I change the ticket name?

Ticket names cannot be changed and tomorrowland can check ID at any time, 

## When does X come out?, when lineup??? when hosts? 

We know just as much as everyone else :P your best bet is to check last years dates and keep an eye on reddit for updates

## Ok I got my ticket :D whats personalization and when do I need to do it?

Congrats! Welcome to the best weekend ever! Now you need to add your details to each of the tickets you have bought. This is known as personalization. You get an email after purchasing tickets with more details and have a short time period after the sales to fill it up. 

> note! if you have bought a global journey package relax this is already done for you.
