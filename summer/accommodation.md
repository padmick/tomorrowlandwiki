# **Camp2Camp**

Camp2camp is about facilitating your camping experience in an ecologically and socially responsible way. You won’t have to bring any camping gear yourself. It will all be ready and pre-pitched for you. By choosing camp2camp, you’ll contribute to a social cause without any extra effort.

&#x200B;

Every festival season tons and tons of camping gear go to waste on festival campsites. Camp2Camp decided to do something about this. Camping gear that would otherwise have gone to waste, is revalorized in a rental formula. Via social employment, each piece of camping gear was thoroughly checked, cleaned and is now ready to be rented to you!

By choosing for a Camp2Camp rental package, you choose to support this project and help create a better future for your fellow people and our planet.

**Note A deposit is paid when collecting Camp2Camp packages which is fully refundable if equipment is left behind in good condition**
